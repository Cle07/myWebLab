# About this site

This site has been made using :

**HTMX** - **Alpine.js** - **Robyn**

My goal was using a stack that is :<br>

1. Minimalist<br>
2. Back-end agnostic<br>
3. Fast

I currently use [Robyn](https://robyn.tech/) which adopt a Python FastAPI-like interface, mixed with a Rust back-end.

I am also interested in [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/) !
